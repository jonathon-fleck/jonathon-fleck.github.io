I am a fifth year PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Utah and I am
working with [Aaron Bertram](https://www.math.utah.edu/~bertram/).  Before
moving to Utah, I received my B.S. and M.S. at Michigan State University.

I am interested in algebraic geometry.  Recently, I have been focused on applying
representation theory and combinatorial structures to study stability conditions
on the derived category of coherent sheaves on a projective variety.
