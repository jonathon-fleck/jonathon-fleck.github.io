I am a Fourth year PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Utah and I am
working with [Tommaso de Fernex](https://www.math.utah.edu/~defernex/).  Before
moving to Utah, I received my B.S. and M.S. at Michigan State University.

I am interested in the birational geometry of higher-dimensional algebraic
varieties, namely studying their Cremona groups and singularities.
Recently, I have been focusing on Fano hypersurfaces and, more generally,
Mori fiber spaces and their birational rigidity via the method of
maximal singularities.  As an application, I am considering how this
can be used to determine rationality over (non-closed) fields.
